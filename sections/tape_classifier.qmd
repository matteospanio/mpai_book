# Tape Irregularity Classifier

Following the image acquisition process, a CNN based on the GoogLeNet network @DBLP:journals/corr/SzegedyLJSRAEVR14 is employed to classify the acquired images. The CNN has undergone training on specific classes, namely splices, brands, shadows and end of tape. While additional types of Irregularities do exist, their inclusion in the classifier's training set was not feasible due to their significantly lower frequency of recurrence, especially compared to the aforementioned classes. Such inclusion would have led to an imbalanced dataset, undermining the effectiveness of the classification model. Therefore, the number of classes was reduced, ensuring a more balanced input for the classifier @10.1162/comj_a_00487.

Separate analyses were conducted on two different datasets: the first one with tapes played at 7.5 ips and the other for tapes played at 15 ips. Both classifiers exhibited an accuracy of $95\%$ during the validation phase, a noteworthy achievement. This high accuracy was further confirmed during the subsequent testing phase, which involved evaluating the performance of the classifiers on frames extracted from the dataset prior to the network's training. This comprehensive evaluation solidifies the robustness and reliability of the developed system.
